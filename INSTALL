ACrypto -- Arduino Crypto Library. Installation.
================================================

Either download a tarball of the latest version or clone from the repository.
The best method is to download to a separate work directory -- not your 
sketchbook directory.

You need to make the library available to the Arduino environment in order
to use it in your sketches.

A. Linux (and other Unix-like OSes)
-----------------------------------

Go to the sketchbook/libraries folder and create a symlink to the ACrypto 
library code, e.g.:

  ln -s ~/working/arduino-crypto/lib/ACrypto Acrypto

The path to the library code depends on the location of the unpacked files.

You can install a test program to upload to your board as follows.
Go to your sketchbook folder and add the symlink

  ln -s ln -s ~/working/arduino-crypto/testing/acrypto_arduino_tests acrypto_arduino_tests

Open this sketch in your Arduino environment, compile and upload to the board.

B. Windows
----------

Copy the ACrypto library code and the test sketch to your sketchbook folder. 



Using the PC test project
=========================

The ACrypto library files compile on any platform and can hence be executed on a 
generic Intel or AMD based platform. We have tested the code on laptops with Intel and AMD
CPUs under Ubuntu Linux as well as Macbooks running OS/X.

The test project is for the code::blocks IDE and enables much more convenient debugging than can
be achieved on an Arduino platform.
