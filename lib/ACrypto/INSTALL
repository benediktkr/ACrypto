Installing the library in the Arduino environment
=================================================

The library must reside under the sketchbook/libraries path. 
You can copy the files in this directory into your sketchbook
directory, i.e. the following path:
  ~/sketchbook/libraries/ACrypto
If you want to keep the ACrypto sources in another directory,
which is in our opinion a better method, is to create a symlink
as follows:
  ln -s ~/working/ACrypto/lib/Acrypto ACrypto
This assumes that you have a working directory and the entire 
distribution set up under ACrypto. Note that the Arduino 
environment only needs the sources and headers under lib/ACrypto.

NOTE: This works on Linux and Unix-like OSes. Windows users
are out of luck as far as we know -- no symlinks.
